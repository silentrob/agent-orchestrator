Spawn parallel AI coding agents, each in its own git worktree. Agents autonomously fix CI failures, address review comments, and open PRs — you supervise from one dashboard.

Agent Orchestrator manages fleets of AI coding agents working in parallel on your codebase. Each agent gets its own git worktree, its own branch, and its own PR. When CI fails, the agent fixes it. When reviewers leave comments, the agent addresses them. You only get pulled in when human judgment is needed.

**Agent-agnostic** (Claude Code, Codex, Aider) · **Runtime-agnostic** (tmux, Docker) · **Tracker-agnostic** (GitHub, Linear, Disk)

## Quick Start

**Option A — From a repo URL (fastest):**

```bash
# Install
git clone https://github.com/ComposioHQ/agent-orchestrator.git
cd agent-orchestrator && bash scripts/setup.sh

# One command to clone, configure, and launch
ao start https://github.com/your-org/your-repo
```

Auto-detects language, package manager, SCM platform, and default branch. Generates `agent-orchestrator.yaml` and starts the dashboard + orchestrator.

**Option B — From an existing local repo:**

```bash
cd ~/your-project && ao init --auto
ao start
```

Then spawn agents:

```bash
ao spawn my-project 123    # GitHub issue, Linear ticket, or ad-hoc
```

Dashboard opens at `http://localhost:3000`. Run `ao status` for the CLI view.

## How It Works

```
ao spawn my-project 123
```

1. **Workspace** creates an isolated git worktree with a feature branch
2. **Runtime** starts a tmux session (or Docker container)
3. **Agent** launches Claude Code (or Codex, or Aider) with issue context
4. Agent works autonomously — reads code, writes tests, creates PR
5. **Reactions** auto-handle CI failures and review comments
6. **Notifier** pings you only when judgment is needed

### Plugin Architecture

Eight slots. Every abstraction is swappable.

| Slot      | Default     | Alternatives             |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Runtime   | tmux        | docker, k8s, process     |
| Agent     | claude-code | codex, aider, opencode   |
| Workspace | worktree    | clone                    |
| Tracker   | github      | linear, disk             |
| SCM       | github      | —                        |
| Notifier  | desktop     | slack, composio, webhook |
| Terminal  | iterm2      | web                      |
| Lifecycle | core        | —                        |

All interfaces defined in [`packages/core/src/types.ts`](packages/core/src/types.ts). A plugin implements one interface and exports a `PluginModule`. That's it.

## Configuration

```yaml
# agent-orchestrator.yaml
port: 3000

defaults:
  runtime: tmux
  agent: claude-code
  workspace: worktree
  notifiers: [desktop]

projects:
  my-app:
    repo: owner/my-app
    path: ~/my-app
    defaultBranch: main
    sessionPrefix: app

reactions:
  ci-failed:
    auto: true
    action: send-to-agent
    retries: 2
  changes-requested:
    auto: true
    action: send-to-agent
    escalateAfter: 30m
  approved-and-green:
    auto: false # flip to true for auto-merge
    action: notify
```

CI fails → agent gets the logs and fixes it. Reviewer requests changes → agent addresses them. PR approved with green CI → you get a notification to merge.

See [`agent-orchestrator.yaml.example`](agent-orchestrator.yaml.example) for the full reference.

### Disk Tracker

The **Disk Tracker** is a local-first issue management system — no GitHub, no Linear account required. Issues are stored as Markdown files in `.ao/issues/` inside your project directory, making them version-controllable and fully offline.

```yaml
projects:
  my-app:
    path: ~/my-app
    tracker:
      plugin: disk
```

Create issues as `.md` files with frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: Fix login bug
state: open
priority: 1
labels: []
---

Describe the issue here.
```

Then spawn an agent against any issue file:

```bash
ao spawn my-app fix-login-bug
```

The Disk Tracker is ideal for local experimentation, air-gapped environments, or projects that don't use a hosted issue tracker.

## CLI

```bash
ao status                              # Overview of all sessions
ao spawn <project> [issue]             # Spawn an agent
ao send <session> "Fix the tests"      # Send instructions
ao session ls                          # List sessions
ao session kill <session>              # Kill a session
ao session restore <session>           # Revive a crashed agent
ao dashboard                           # Open web dashboard
ao doctor [--fix]                      # Check install, runtime, and stale temp issues
ao update                              # Update local AO install and run smoke tests
```

## Maintenance

```bash
# Run deterministic install and runtime checks
ao doctor

# Apply safe cleanup and launcher fixes
ao doctor --fix

# Update this local AO checkout, rebuild critical packages, and verify the launcher
ao update
```

`ao doctor` checks PATH and launcher resolution, required binaries, tmux and GitHub CLI health, config support directories, stale AO temp files, and core build/runtime sanity. `ao update` fast-forwards the local install repo on `main`, runs `pnpm install`, clean-rebuilds `@composio/ao-core`, `@composio/ao-cli`, and `@composio/ao-web`, refreshes the global `ao` launcher with `npm link`, and finishes with CLI smoke tests.

## Why Agent Orchestrator?

Running one AI agent in a terminal is easy. Running 30 across different issues, branches, and PRs is a coordination problem.

**Without orchestration**, you manually: create branches, start agents, check if they're stuck, read CI failures, forward review comments, track which PRs are ready to merge, clean up when done.

**With Agent Orchestrator**, you: `ao spawn` and walk away. The system handles isolation, feedback routing, and status tracking. You review PRs and make decisions — the rest is automated.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Git 2.25+
- tmux (for default runtime)
- `gh` CLI (for GitHub integration)

## Development

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm build    # Install and build all packages
pnpm test                      # Run tests (3,288 test cases)
pnpm dev                       # Start web dashboard dev server
```

See [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for code conventions and architecture details.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome. The plugin system makes it straightforward to add support for new agents, runtimes, trackers, and notification channels. Every plugin is an implementation of a TypeScript interface — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [Development Guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for the pattern.
